## üìÇ Project Highlights  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Influenza Deaths Data Visualization - Age Group 65+ Insights 
- **Objective:** The objective of this Tableau bubble chart is to explore and visualize the relationship between the population of individuals aged 65 and above and the corresponding influenza-related deaths within the same age group. The chart provides a clear, interactive way to understand how population size and death rates correlate, helping public health professionals make informed decisions regarding the elderly population's health.  
- **Key Features:**
  -  **Bubble Chart Visualization**  
    The bubble chart visually represents the relationship between the population of the 65+ age group and influenza-related deaths, using the size and position of the bubbles to indicate the data points.
  - **Age Group 65+ Focus:** Concentrates on the population aged 65 and above, providing insights into this key demographic's health trends.
  - **Interactive Filtering:** Allows users to interact with the chart to filter by various time periods or other relevant metrics for deeper analysis.
  - **Trend Analysis:** The chart highlights patterns and trends in the data, including seasonal spikes in influenza-related deaths.
  - **Data-Driven Decisions:** Empowers researchers and policymakers with data-driven insights to address influenza-related fatalities among older adults.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Influenza Vaccination Rate vs. Deaths Data Analysis

- **Objective:**  
 The objective of this Tableau report is to explore and visualize the trends in influenza-related deaths across different states in the USA over multiple years. By analyzing this data, the report aims to highlight regional variations, identify spikes in mortality, and support health professionals and policymakers in targeting interventions where they are most needed. This interactive visualization enables a better understanding of how influenza death rates change over time at the state level.

- **Key Features:**
  - **State-Level Breakdown**  
   Visualizes influenza-related deaths across different states in the USA, allowing users to compare mortality trends between regions..
  - **Yearly Trends:**  
    Tracks and displays how influenza death rates fluctuate year over year, identifying any noticeable increases or declines.
  - **Interactive Filters:**  
    Allows users to filter the data by specific years or states for a more detailed, focused analysis of the trends.
  - **Regional Comparisons:**  
    Highlights which states have experienced the highest or lowest death rates and allows for comparison across states with similar population sizes or healthcare resources.
  - **Death Rate Insights:**  
    Provides data-driven insights into the effectiveness of public health initiatives, vaccination programs, and other factors affecting mortality.
