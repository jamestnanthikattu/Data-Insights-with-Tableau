## üìÇ Project Highlights  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Influenza Deaths Data Visualization - Age Group 65+ Insights 
- **Objective:** The objective of this Tableau bubble chart is to explore and visualize the relationship between the population of individuals aged 65 and above and the corresponding influenza-related deaths within the same age group. The chart provides a clear, interactive way to understand how population size and death rates correlate, helping public health professionals make informed decisions regarding the elderly population's health.  
- **Key Features:**
  -  **Bubble Chart Visualization**  
    The bubble chart visually represents the relationship between the population of the 65+ age group and influenza-related deaths, using the size and position of the bubbles to indicate the data points.
  - **Age Group 65+ Focus:** Concentrates on the population aged 65 and above, providing insights into this key demographic's health trends.
  - **Interactive Filtering:** Allows users to interact with the chart to filter by various time periods or other relevant metrics for deeper analysis.
  - **Trend Analysis:** The chart highlights patterns and trends in the data, including seasonal spikes in influenza-related deaths.
  - **Data-Driven Decisions:** Empowers researchers and policymakers with data-driven insights to address influenza-related fatalities among older adults.

  This analysis focuses on visualizing the correlation between influenza vaccination rates and influenza-related deaths in the 65+ age group. By investigating vaccination coverage and its relationship with mortality rates, the report offers insights into the effectiveness of vaccination programs in reducing deaths.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Bubble Chart Visualization**  
    Displays vaccination rates versus death rates in a bubble chart format, illustrating how vaccination levels impact the number of deaths.
  - **Vaccination Rate Focus:**  
    Analyzes vaccination coverage for individuals aged 65 and above and how it relates to influenza mortality.
  - **Comparative Insights:**  
    Offers insights by comparing regions with varying vaccination rates to identify potential areas for improvement.
  - **Health Policy Impact:**  
    Assists policymakers in evaluating the effectiveness of vaccination strategies and where more emphasis may be needed.
